## Program 4: To display operators in c
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
 int a = 24, b = 4;
 int addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus;
 
 addition = a + b; 
 subtraction = a - b; 
 multiplication = a * b; 
 division = a / b; 
 modulus = a % b; 
 
 printf("Adding of two numbers a, b is : %d\n", addition);
 printf("Subtracting of two numbers a, b is : %d\n", subtraction);
 printf("Multiplying two numbers a, b is : %d\n", multiplication);
 printf("Division of two numbers a, b is : %d\n", division);
 printf("Modulus of two numbers a, b is : %d\n", modulus);

}
```
### OUTPUT:
```
Adding of two numbers a, b is : 28
Subtracting of two numbers a, b is : 20
Multiplying two numbers a, b is : 96
Division of two numbers a, b is : 6
Modulus of two numbers a, b is : 0

```
